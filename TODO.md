## TODO for pokeswap client
 - ✔️ configure/setup ts/electron/react project

    **basic boilerplate works**

    just need to outline some basic functionality and learn some react I suppose

    - ✔️ add sidebar template
    - ✔️ extend `sidebar.tsx` to wrap components
    - ✔️ create pages for 'configuration' and 'lobby'
    - ✔️ for configuation page, add Rom Path file select and BizHawk Path file select
    - ✔️ for lobby page, just add start button for now (login stuff will come later)

    **all done with basic project set up**

    technically, I could go more in depth into the css but nah
